    ## Summarization
    Summarization, as the name suggests, is the process of shortening of set of data (text, video or audio), to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. 
    In machine learning, Summarization can be 
    - Abstractive - AI Model build an internal semantic representation of the original content, and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express
    - Extractive - AI Model indentifies and extracts content from the original data, but the extracted content is not modified in any way.

    Summarization has many applications such as keyphrase extraction, query based summarization, single document summarization, multi-document summarization etc. Training of summarization systems can be done using supervised and unsupervised algorithms

    ## Machine Translation
    using **T5**

    Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the abbreviation MT, is a sub-field of computational linguistics that uses AI to translate text or speech from one language to another.
    
    Select one of the 3 sample texts given below or enter your desired text which needs to be translated in the input box and select the language to be translated into. You check the translated version below it.
